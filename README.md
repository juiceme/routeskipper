#RouteSkipper

A routing tool that's meant to be used on the move.

## Current status
Basic functionality is pretty much there, but there are a lot of rough edges to file down.

## TODO
### Big issues
- *Map view* is an essential tool, but I'm waiting for QtLocation and QtPositioning to be available
- *GPS functions* also require aforementioned libraries
- *Live data* will be implemented next

### Other stuff
- Refactoring, commenting and documenting - always on the list
- Especially the javascript functions are a mess.
- *UI and usability tweaks* - a lot of them

## Known issues
- i18n is not done. Just Finnish for now.
