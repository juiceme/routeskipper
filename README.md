#RouteSkipper

A routing tool that's meant to be used on the move.

## Current status
Basic functionality is pretty much there, but there are a lot of rough edges to file down.

## TODO
### Big issues
- *Map view* is an essential tool, but I'm waiting for QtLocation and QtPositioning to be available
- *GPS functions* also require aforementioned libraries
- *Live data* will be implemented next

### Other stuff
- Properly separating model and UI so other datasources besides HSL can be used. Contact me if you're interested.

## Known issues
- It kind of works
- The UI could be better. It's a neverending battle :)
